| OK     | Confirm. Hold on main screen for model menu. Short press on main screen for popup menu. |
| CANCEL | Exit.                                                                              |                      
| BIND   | Scroll pages right or left (long press), go right in a line. Hold on main screen for general menu. |

## Shutdown

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a software controlled shutdown button, therefore do not switch off you device when you see small square icon in top right corner of main screen - it indicates that there are settings not yet saved. Wait until it disappears or use "Save all" option from main screen popup menu.

When to use "Save all" option:
* When you don't want to wait until square icon disapper before shutdown.
* With USB connected - when USB is connected then settings are not stored with standard delay.
* To save timers.

## Mode 1 radios

With Mode 1 radio you may experience inverted gimbal movement and swapped gimbals on main screen. To fix this swap gimbal connectors (red-white one with black-white one).
