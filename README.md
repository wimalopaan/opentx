## Navigation

| Key | Function                                                                                           |
| --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UP     | Up. Scroll values. Hold on main screen for stats.                                                  |                              
| DOWN   | Down. Scroll values. Hold on main screen for telemetry.                                            |                                  
| OK     | Confirm. Hold on main screen for model menu. Short press on main screen for popup menu.            |
| CANCEL | Exit/Back/Cancel.                                                                                  |                      
| BIND   | Scroll pages right or left (long press), go right in a line. Hold on main screen for general menu. |

## Shutdown

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a software controlled shutdown button, therefore do not switch off radio when you see `▫` icon in top right corner of main screen - it indicates that settings are not yet saved. Wait until it disappears or use "Save all" option from main screen popup menu.

When to use "Save all" option:
* When you don't want to wait until square icon disapper before shutdown.
* With USB connected - when USB is connected then settings are not stored with standard delay.
* To save timers.

## USB connection

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a USB VBUS making it impossible to detect USB connection. Without modification, you need to press OK on main screen and select "USB Connect" everytime you've connected USB (In version 1.8.0 or earlier it's in: Radio Setup -> "USB Detect").<br>
Automatic connection detection can be added by wiring `PA15` pad to USB VBUS preferably with a resistor (I have used 1K).

## Powering by 2S Li-Po/Li-ion/18650

FlySky i6X is officially rated for up to 6V, internal regulators are rated for up to 6.5V, but i don't guarantee that. Running anything above will damage your radio. Use step-down regulator to lower voltage to safe values.

## Mode 1 & Mode 3 radios

With Mode 1 & Mode 3 radios you may experience inverted gimbal movement and swapped gimbals on main screen. To fix this swap gimbal connectors (red-white one with black-white one).

## All optional hardware connections

| PCB Pad    | Function                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `TX2`      | S.Port (CRSF)                                         |
| `PA9`      | AUX Serial port TX                                    |
| `PA10`     | AUX Serial port RX                                    |
| `PA15`     | USB VBUS (USB connection detection)                   |
| `PC13`     | External module power control (it was `PC9` up to OpenI6X 1.5.0) |
| `PC9`+`BL` | Wiring those together allows for adjustable backlight |

## Adjustable backlight level mod

Wire `PC9` and `BL` pads together.

* Mariano ([marianomd](https://github.com/marianomd)), continued Kuba's work and made it up to useable condition! Added AFHDS2A, PPM, CRSF.
* Kuba ([qba667](https://github.com/qba667)), started this work and made this project possible, it is forked from his repo.
* Wilhelm ([wimalopaan](https://github.com/wimalopaan)) added 16 channels SBUS16 / IBUS16 modes.
* Tom ([tmcadam](https://github.com/tmcadam)) fixed AFHDS2A PWM mode selection.
* The internal RF code was taken from the great KotelloRC's [erfly6: Er9X for i6 and i6x](https://bitbucket.org/KotelloRC/erfly6/src/master/).
* Some of the internal RF fixes are a result of analysing [pascallanger's](https://github.com/pascallanger) [DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module).
* ExpressLRS configurator is based on elrsV2/V3.lua from [ExpressLRS](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS).
* Some of the ports are from [EdgeTX](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx/).
* ADC code taken from [OpenGround](https://github.com/fishpepper/OpenGround).
