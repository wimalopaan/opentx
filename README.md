## Shutdown

Do not switch off you device when you see small square icon in top right corner of main screen - it indicates that there are settings not yet stored. Wait until it disappears or use graceful shutdown method.

FlySky FS-i6X don't have graceful shutdown button like other OpenTX devices, but you can trigger it by holding CANCEL button until screen turns off, then use switch.

When to use this method:
* With USB connected - when USB is connected then settings are not stored with standard delay.
* To save timers.

## Mode 1

With Mode 1 radio you may experience inverted gimbal movement and swapped gimbals on main screen. To fix this swap gimbal connectors (red-white one with black-white one).

## Hardware connections (optional)
