## Navigation

| Key | Function                                                                                           |
| --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UP     | Up. Scroll values. Hold on main screen for stats.                                                  |                              
| DOWN   | Down. Scroll values. Hold on main screen for telemetry.                                            |                                  
| OK     | Confirm. Hold on main screen for model menu. Short press on main screen for popup menu.            |
| CANCEL | Exit/Back/Cancel.                                                                                  |                      
| BIND   | Scroll pages right or left (long press), go right in a line. Hold on main screen for general menu. |

## Shutdown

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a software controlled shutdown button, therefore do not switch off radio when you see `▫` icon in top right corner of main screen - it indicates that settings are not yet saved. Wait until it disappears or use "Save all" option from main screen popup menu.

When to use "Save all" option:
* When you don't want to wait until square icon disapper before shutdown.
* With USB connected - when USB is connected then settings are not stored with standard delay.
* To save timers.

## USB connection

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a USB VBUS making it impossible to detect USB connection. Without the modification you have to go to General settings and set USB Detect to "Once" everytime you're connecting USB.<br>
Auto connection detection can be added manually by wiring `PA15` to USB VBUS preferably with a resistor (I have used 1K).


## Mode 1 & Mode 3 radios

With Mode 1 & Mode 3 radios you may experience inverted gimbal movement and swapped gimbals on main screen. To fix this swap gimbal connectors (red-white one with black-white one).

## All optional hardware connections

| PCB Pad    | Function                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `TX2`      | S.Port (CRSF)                                         |
| `PA9`      | AUX Serial port TX                                    |
| `PA10`     | AUX Serial port RX                                    |
| `PA15`     | USB VBUS (USB connection detection)                   |
| `PC13`     | External module power control (it was `PC9` up to OpenI6X 1.5.0) |
| `PC9`+`BL` | Wiring those together allows for adjustable backlight |

## Adjustable backlight level mod

Wire `PC9` and `BL` pads together.
